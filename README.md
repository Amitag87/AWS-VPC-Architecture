# AWS-VPC-Architecture

Overview

The VPC Architecture project involves designing and deploying a secure, scalable, and highly available cloud infrastructure using AWS EC2, VPC, Subnets, Security Groups, and Internet Gateway. This architecture ensures efficient network segmentation, resource management, and optimized performance for production workloads.


Features

Custom Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): Designed a VPC with public and private subnets for secure application hosting.
Network Segmentation: Implemented efficient network isolation using private and public subnets.
Autoscaling and Load Balancing: Configured autoscaling groups and load balancers to manage traffic surges and enhance system reliability.
Secure Access Management: Configured a Bastion Host for secure access to private subnets.
High Availability & Redundancy: Ensured system resilience across multiple availability zones.

Technologies Used

AWS VPC – Created a custom virtual network for cloud resources.
AWS EC2 – Hosted applications securely within private/public subnets.
AWS Subnets – Segmented network for controlled traffic flow.
Security Groups – Defined security rules to control inbound and outbound traffic.
Internet Gateway – Provided internet access to public-facing instances.
Bastion Host – Secured SSH access to private subnet instances.
AWS Load Balancer & Auto Scaling – Managed traffic distribution and automatic scaling of resources.

Architecture Design


VPC Setup:
Created a VPC with public and private subnets.
Assigned CIDR blocks for efficient IP address allocation.

Security Configuration:
Configured Security Groups and NACLs for controlled access.
Restricted unauthorized traffic using firewall rules.

Compute & Scaling:
Launched EC2 instances across multiple availability zones.
Configured Auto Scaling Groups and an Application Load Balancer.

Access & Connectivity:
Deployed a Bastion Host for secure SSH access to private instances.
Connected public instances to the internet via an Internet Gateway.


Deployment Steps
Set up the VPC using AWS Console or Terraform.
Configure subnets, route tables, and security groups.
Launch EC2 instances in public/private subnets.
Implement an Auto Scaling Group and Load Balancer.
Set up a Bastion Host for secure remote access.
Test connectivity and security policies.

Future Enhancements
VPN Integration for hybrid cloud connectivity.
VPC Peering for inter-VPC communication.
AWS Transit Gateway for multi-VPC networking.
CloudWatch Monitoring & Alerts for performance tracking.
