#Overview
This infrastructure is defined and provisioned using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles, ensuring consistent, version-controlled, and repeatable environment deployments.

#Core Technologies

Cloud Provider

Amazon Web Services (AWS) - Primary cloud infrastructure provider

Infrastructure as Code
HashiCorp Terraform (~> 1.0) - Infrastructure provisioning and management

#AWS Services Architecture
#Networking
1)AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) - Isolated network environment

2)Internet Gateway (IGW) - Provides internet access to resources within the VPC

3)NAT Gateway - Allows private subnets to access the internet while remaining secure

4)Compute
->EC2 Auto Scaling Groups - Automatically scales EC2 instances based on demand

->EC2 Launch Templates - Defines instance configuration for auto-scaling

5)Load Balancing & Distribution
Application Load Balancer (ALB) - Distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets

6)Security
Security Groups - Virtual firewalls controlling inbound and outbound traffic

7)Configuration Management
User Data Scripts - Instance bootstrapping and initial configuration (Assumed)

#Architecture Benefits

1)Scalability: Auto-scaling ensures resources match demand

2)High Availability: Distributed across availability zones

3)Security: Network isolation and security groups protect resources

4)Cost Optimization: Pay only for resources actually consumed

5)Reproducibility: Infrastructure defined as code for consistent environments

#Deployment Workflow
Terraform configuration defines desired infrastructure state

Terraform plan validates changes

Terraform apply provisions/updates AWS resources

Auto Scaling Groups deploy EC2 instances using Launch Templates

User Data scripts configure instances on boot

ALB routes traffic to healthy instances

This infrastructure stack provides a robust, scalable foundation for web applications with proper security, high availability, and automated scaling capabilities.
