Overview
This infrastructure is defined and provisioned using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles, ensuring consistent, version-controlled, and repeatable environment deployments.

Core Technologies
Cloud Provider
Amazon Web Services (AWS) - Primary cloud infrastructure provider

Infrastructure as Code
HashiCorp Terraform (~> 1.0) - Infrastructure provisioning and management

AWS Services Architecture
Networking
AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) - Isolated network environment

Internet Gateway (IGW) - Provides internet access to resources within the VPC

NAT Gateway - Allows private subnets to access the internet while remaining secure

Compute
EC2 Auto Scaling Groups - Automatically scales EC2 instances based on demand

EC2 Launch Templates - Defines instance configuration for auto-scaling

Load Balancing & Distribution
Application Load Balancer (ALB) - Distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets

Security
Security Groups - Virtual firewalls controlling inbound and outbound traffic

Configuration Management
User Data Scripts - Instance bootstrapping and initial configuration (Assumed)

Architecture Benefits
Scalability: Auto-scaling ensures resources match demand

High Availability: Distributed across availability zones

Security: Network isolation and security groups protect resources

Cost Optimization: Pay only for resources actually consumed

Reproducibility: Infrastructure defined as code for consistent environments

Deployment Workflow
Terraform configuration defines desired infrastructure state

Terraform plan validates changes

Terraform apply provisions/updates AWS resources

Auto Scaling Groups deploy EC2 instances using Launch Templates

User Data scripts configure instances on boot

ALB routes traffic to healthy instances

This infrastructure stack provides a robust, scalable foundation for web applications with proper security, high availability, and automated scaling capabilities.
